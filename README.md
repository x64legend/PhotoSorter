# PhotoSorter
Sorts .nef and .jpg files for photos to be kept.
This script sorts both .nef (raw) photos and .jpg photos from a source folder and into a destination folder. 
It works by importing a .csv with the full names of the files (without filetypes) that should be kept.
For example:

name
DSC_4020
DSC_4028
DSC_4039

And so forth.
